# Localization GAN
This is the source code for the paper [Using Synthetic Data to Enhance the Accuracy of Fingerprint-based Localization: A Deep Learning Approach](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8981805), IEEE Sensors Letters,  vol. 4, no. 4, pp. 1-4, April 2020, doi: 10.1109/LSENS.2020.2971555. 

This code utilzies Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to enhance the accuracy of WiFi Recieved Signal Strength (RSS) fingerprint-based localziation methods.

The benchmark dataset is taken from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wireless+Indoor+Localization) and is collected by Rajen Bhatt. Releveant papers regarding to the dataset can be found in the "data" folder.
